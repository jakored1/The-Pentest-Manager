# The Pentest Manager

### What is this?
The Pentest Manager is a program that runs localy, and is built to help you manage all the info you gather throughout your pentest, make it comfortable to find, and easy to continue working where you left off.

### Why?
After a while of working on various CTFs I grew tired of constantly having to save different commands outputs and scroll through a long notepad to find what I was looking for. I decided I needed to make the process easier and more comfortable seeing as it was part of every pentest. I looked all over the internet for something of the sort but couldn't find what I was looking for (btw if you know of something like this that already exists let me know), so I decided to make my own :)

### How does it work?
When opening the website you are able to create a new 'project'.  
Each project represents a company (for example) you are pentesting.  
Once creating a project, you can add 'hosts' to it.  
The hosts are the different servers of the company you are pentesting.  
After creating a project and adding hosts, start the pentest!  
'modules' commands (nmap, wfuzz and more), can be run via the website and their output is stored, displayed nicely and easily accessible for easy reference further down the line.  
Each project can have files associated to it (for example custom made wordlists, or credentials found throughout the pentest), that are easily accessable and can be referenced in module commands (for exmaple, using creds file found in pentest in a hydra command).

Each project and host also have notes (write notes for yourself regarding the project/host), and an 'attack chain' feature.  
An attack chain is a file containing all the commands you ran to exploit a certain target.  
You can write down your attack chain for each host, and then run it in your terminal via the 'pmcli' (still under development) to continue working where you left off.

### Installation


### For Developers
The project was developed with React (front end) and Python (back end) on a linux OS.  
These are all the libraries I used in the front/back-end that you will need to install, to develop your own versions of the project:
#### Front End:
```
npm install antd axios react-string-replace @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @emotion/css
```
#### Back End:
```
python3 -m pip install flask flask-restful flask-cors xmltodict sqlite3
```

### Future Plans
* **pmcli** - There is another part of the projects that is yet to be developed - pmcli. You might see it referenced a few times in the website, it has not been made yet. The pmcli will be a command line interface that has all of the websites functionality and a bit more. It will be made for people who prefer cli, and to allow some functions that did not work well with a web interface.

### Disclaimers
I'm sure you might find bugs in the project as I'm not a professional developer.  
If some of the code is not written well, or you might have found a typo - feel free to edit the project and request to merge it with the main branch of the project!  
Nevertheless, everything should work (from the tests I have done)
