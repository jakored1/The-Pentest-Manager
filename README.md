# The Pentest Manager

#### What is this?
The Pentest Manager is a program that runs localy, and is built to help you manage all the info you gather throughout your petnest, make it comfortable to find, and easy to continue working where you left off.

### How does it work?
When opening the website you are able to create a new 'project'.
Each project represents a company you are pentesting.
Once creating a project, you can add 'hosts' to it. The hosts are the different servers for example of the company you are pentesting.
After creating a project, and adding hosts, start the pentest!
'modules' commands (nmap, wfuzz and more), can be run via the website and their output is stored, displayed nicely and easily accessible for easy reference further down the line.
Each project can have files associated to it (for example custom made wordlists, or credentials found throughout the pentest), that are easily accessable and can be referenced in module commands.
